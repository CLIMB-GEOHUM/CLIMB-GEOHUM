# Climate-Induced Migration Analysis using Remote Sensing and Earth Observation

![Project Logo](logo.png) 🌍 📊 🌿

## 🚀 Overview
This repository contains tools and scripts for analyzing climate-induced migration patterns using remote sensing and Earth observation data. The project leverages geospatial analysis and social data integration to identify and map migration drivers influenced by climate events.

### ✨ Key Features:
- 🛰️ Remote sensing analysis for environmental drivers (e.g., drought, floods, land cover changes)
- 📊 Social media analysis to understand migration patterns and integration
- ✅ Data quality assessments and validation methods
